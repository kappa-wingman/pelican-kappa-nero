pelican-kappa-nero
------------------

This theme is copied from pelican-bootstrap3-nero and pelican-bootstrap3 with lots of customization.

I could not update the related changes that should be made for translation (foreign languages).

Use it at your own risk.

- For this theme:
 
  - The changes and parameters are incompatible with
    the original pelican-bootstrap3 and pelican-bootstrap3-nero or pelican-bootstrap4-nero.
  - The theme is customized to my preference.
